## What Are Skills?

Skills are customizable workflows that teach AI assistants how to perform specific tasks according to your unique requirements. Skills enable AI assistants to execute tasks in a repeatable, standardized manner across different platforms and interfaces.

Skills work seamlessly with **Command Code**  providing consistent, high-quality outputs that follow best practices and maintain code quality standards.

## Skills

</a>
</p>

[Command Code](https://commandcode.ai) is a coding agent designed with taste and attention to detail. To use skills with Command Code:

1. Place the skill in your `.commandcode/skills` directory
2. Command Code will automatically detect and activate relevant skills based on your task
3. Skills enhance Command Code's capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows


## Skill Structure

Each skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: Skill instructions and metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: Helper scripts
├── templates/        # Optional: Document templates
└── resources/        # Optional: Reference files
```

### Basic Skill Template

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: A clear description of what this skill does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill Name
